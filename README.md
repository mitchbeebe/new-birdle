# New Birdle

This is a Python/Django version of the original [Birdle](https://github.com/mitchbeebe/birdle), which was written in R/Shiny. The new game will feature several improvements:

- Improved system uptime (no more grey screen!)
- More birds (10k+)
- Multiple photos (often male/female/juvenile)
- Map of habitat distribution
- Improved stats page
- Practice page to improve your bird recognition

These changes are expected to be live in the next few weeks.

Future features may include account creation, practice stats, additional media on the bird of the day such as bird calls, and more.
