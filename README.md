# New Birdle

This is a Python/Django version of the original [Birdle](https://www.play-birdle.com), which was written in R/Shiny [here](https://github.com/mitchbeebe/birdle). The new game will feature several improvements:

- Improved system uptime (no more grey screen!)
- More birds (10k+)
- Multiple photos (often male/female/juvenile)
- Map of habitat distribution
- Improved stats page
- Practice page to improve your bird recognition

These changes are expected to be live in the next few weeks. See the demo below for a sneak peek.

Future features may include account creation, practice stats, additional media on the bird of the day such as bird calls, and more.
