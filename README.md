# New Birdle

This is a Python/Django version of the original [Birdle](https://www.play-birdle.com), which was written in R/Shiny [here](https://github.com/mitchbeebe/birdle). 

The new game features several improvements:

- 🛜 Improved system uptime (no more grey screen!)
- 🐦 More birds (10k+)
- 🌎 Region selection that limits the daily bird, autocomplete suggestions, stats, and copied results to the selected region (this also means up to 8 daily games!)
- 📸 Multiple photos (often male/female/juvenile, but really whatever photos/labels are available on eBird)
- 🗺️ Map of habitat distribution
- 📊 Better stats page
- 📚 Practice page to improve your bird recognition

Future features may include account creation, leaderboards, practice stats, additional media on the bird of the day such as bird calls, and more.
